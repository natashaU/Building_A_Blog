Hi! I'm Natasha! I'm a journalist, video producer, science communicator, and aspiring web developer who has worked for a few startsups that you might have heard of - Reddit and BuzzFeed. After observing a huge disconnect between writers/producers and coders, I decided to learn to program to bridge that gap and to gain the power to create my own platform. Follow me on my journey and learn to code your own blog, too.
